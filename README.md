## Note
This Unity game was fully developed by our team to fulfill the requirements of the CSC404 Group Project, which tasked us with building a game from scratch. <br>
Please note that we used Unity Collaborate for collaborative coding, while GitHub was used solely to share art assets with our Art Team.
